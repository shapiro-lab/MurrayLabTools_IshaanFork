    "The \"echo\" subpackage of murraylab_tools is designed to automate the setup of reactions with the Echo, with special functionality provided for TX-TL reactions. The EchoRun class can produce picklists for the Echo, as well as instructions for loading a source plate to go with those instructions, when appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently three main modes of operations of the Echo package, distinguished mainly by their inputs:\n",
    "- **TX-TL Setup Spreadsheet**: Takes a pair of CSV spreadsheets saved from a TX-TL setup spreadsheet (version 2.X). Use this for simple TX-TL experiments, or very complex experiments that would be easier to set up in a spreadsheet than programmatically.\n",
    "- **Programmatic Setup**: You can build a reaction programmatically, straight from code. Build objects representing the materials you want to use (including mixtures of things) and add them to wells on a destination plate with:\n",
    "    - **`dilution_series`**: Takes two materials and an array of concentrations for each, and builds a 2D dilution series out of the two. Can also be used to set up 1D dilution series (by setting one of the materials to a dummy material and giving it the concentration list [0]).\n",
    "    - **`add_material_to_well`, `add_material_to_block`, `add_material_to_all`**: Adds a single ingredient at a fixed concentration, volume, or fraction of the final reaction to either a single well, a rectangular block of wells, or all wells that the EchoRun object has used so far, respectively.\n",
    "    - **`fill_well_with`,`fill_all_with`**: Whatever volume is left in either a well or every well the EchoRun object has interacted with so far, respectively, fill with a material.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Association Spreadsheet**: Takes one or more spreadsheets describing the contents of an Echo source plate, plus a simple spreadsheet describing final concentrations of the materials of those source plates in each destination. You can use this if you are more comfortable working with spreadsheets than with Python."

    "*A word of warning*: The quick start examples will help you jump right into setting up an experiment, but they make a number of assumptions about your experiment. Some things you'll want to check before running your own:\n",
    "- **Reaction Size**: Default is 10 µL.\n",
    "- **Buffer/Extract Fractions**: Defaults are 0.42/0.33 (typical for French Press extracts).\n",
    "- **Buffer/Extract Aliquot Size**: Defaults are 30µL/37µL per aliquot, respectively. \n",
    "- **Master Mix Excess**: For accounting for pipetting loss. Default is 1.1 (10% excess) for `TXTLMasterMix`, and 1 (no excess) for `MixtureMaterial`.\n",
    "- **Source Plate Type**: Default is 384_PP. You probably want this.\n",
    "- **Source Plate Material**: Default is AQ_BP (buffer-like liquids).\n",
    "- **Destination Plate Type**: Default is \"Nunc_384_black_glassbottom\".\n",
    "- **Destination Plate Size**: The Echo package has no knowledge of the destination plate. *There is no check to keep you from defining picks off the edge of the destination plate*. Don't do that.\n",
    "- **Dead Volume/Max Volume**: Default dead volume is 21 µL, including loss to meniscus. Default max volume is 65 µL. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Additionally, be aware** that the TX-TL setup scripts keep track of which source plate wells they've used in a .dat file. If you run those experiments repeatedly, they'll fill up the file and eventually error out when they run out of wells on the plate. You should test your code using a dummy .dat file, then switch to the one you actually want to use and run it again once you're sure your code works.\n",

    "Every project begins with an `EchoRun` object. This object holds (nearly) all of the information about an experiment, and is ultimately responsible for coordinating plates and materials, and for actually writing picklists and experimental protocols. \n",
    "\n",
    "An `EchoRun` object needs a `SourcePlate` object. This object is responsible for keeping track of which wells have been used, and for assigning new wells on the source plate to materials that you'll want to transfer. It will try to assign wells in a way that keeps the same material in a contiguous block, buffered on either side by an empty well for ease of pipetting. `SourcePlate` objects are also typically associated with a .dat tracking file that lists which wells have been used on the plate. That way, you can use the same source plate over many experiments without having to manually program in which wells are forbidden. The `SourcePlate` object will read this file to learn what it has available to it, and will automatically write back to the same file whenever the EchoRun object controlling it writes a picklist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Materials (DNA, chemicals, water, TX-TL, etc) on a source plate are represented by `EchoSourceMaterial` objects. An `EchoSourceMaterial` has a concentration, which can be of any units you want. For the most part, units are only there for human readability. Special exceptions are made for dsDNAs, which are usually kept in stocks with units of ng/uL and used in units of nM. `EchoSourceMaterial`s representing dsDNAs are created with a \"length\". If an `EchoSourceMaterial` has a \"length\" > 0, then it will assume it was a dsDNA created in units of ng/uL, and will immediately convert its concentration into nM. Anything using that material should use units of nM.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate an Echo picklist, you will generally need to do three things:\n",
    "- Build an `EchoRun` object. This will take a `SourcePlate` object, which usually just needs to know the location of the used-well file.\n",
    "- Describe the experiment. This means calling one of three things from your `EchoRun` object: \n",
    "    - `build_picklist_from_txtl_setup_csvs`, or\n",
    "    - `load_source_plate` to learn what's on the source plate and `build_picklist_from_association_spreadsheet` to figure out what goes where on the destination plate, or \n",
    "    - Programmatic setup using `dilution_series`, `add_material_to_well`, `fill_well_with`, etc.\n",
    "- Write the picklist, which is done with a call to `write_picklist` from your `EchoRun` object. \n",

    "The second 'association' spreadsheet (describing the what materials go together) is also a CSV-format spreadsheet. This spreadsheet determines what goes into the destination well. One column of the association spreadsheet determines that row's well on the destination plate. The EchoRun object will scan through every column, ignoring the well column, taking pairs of columns from left to right. There can be any number of pairs of columns; each one will cause one material to be moved from the source plate to the destination plate. The first clumn in each pair holds the name of a material. This name must exactly match one of the material names listed in the source spreadsheet, and determines where material will be taken from. The second column in each pair describes the *final* concentration of that material. If the material is dsDNA (has non-zero length), the units of final concentration are assumed to be nM. Otherwise, the units of final concentration are the same as the units of concentration used for that material in the source plate.\n",
