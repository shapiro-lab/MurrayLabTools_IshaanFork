    """this function contains some helpful pre-sets for doing multiple
    inducer sweeps in a 384 well plate.
    inducers:
    this is a list of lists that looks like this:
    [ ["name",[int(amount1),int(amount2)],["well",number of wells]]]

    "name"
    is the name of the inducer. for example, "ATC" or "ARA"

    amount1, amount2
    are the percent of the 'maxinducer' volume to add. for
    example, if you put '50', that means 50 percent of the max inducer volume
    (which is default 500), so the echo will add 250 nl of that inducer.

    "well" is the well where your inducers will start, in the source plate.
    You will need about 220 ul to populate an entire 384 well plate which does
    not fit into one source plate well. This is why we usually do many source
    plate wells. The first of these is denoted by "well", and the rest are placed
    vertically downwards in the plate. For example if you put "K1" here, you also
    need to put inducer into wells "L1","M1", and "N1", or more or less wells in
    a vertical column as determined by the number given by 'number of wells.'

    constructs:

    This is a list of strings that denote the names of the different constructs
    you are going to use. Each construct gets the same array of inducers.

    fname:

    this is the name of the file you want to make. Usually "date.csv". The program
    also makes "supp_<fname>" as a supplementary data file used with the biotek analysis
    package.

    avoidwells:

    a list of numbers indicating which wells to avoid. Use the two predifined lists
    called "edges" or "topbottom" to block out all edge wells or the top and bottom rows

    maxinducer:

    "100%" volume of inducer to add. Usually 500 nl so it's 100x diluted into the
    50 uL culture volume.

    wellvol:

    culture volume

    shuffle:

    True means that the wells which recieve different inducer concentrations Will
    be randomly distributed within the set of wells set aside for each construct.

    wellorder:

    "across" means lettered rows from left to right. A1 -> A2 -> A3 etc
    "down" means columns down (letters in order) then left to right. So, A1 -> B1
    ->->A2 -> B2 etc.
